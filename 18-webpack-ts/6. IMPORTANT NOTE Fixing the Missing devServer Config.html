<h4><strong>PLEASE&nbsp;READ!&nbsp;Important note about fixing an issue with missing configuration code in the next video lecture</strong></h4><p>In the next lecture named "<strong>Webpack Dev Server</strong>", the <code>devServer</code> configuration code was added to the <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> file without it being explicitly shown in that video lecture.</p><p>Namely, at the <strong>2:15</strong> timestamp (at the 2 minutes 15 seconds point)&nbsp;in the mentioned next video lecture named "Webpack Dev Server", we need to add this <code>devServer</code> configuration code to our <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> file:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">devServer: {
  static: {
    directory: path.join(__dirname, "./"),
  },
},</pre><p>You should add this configuration code appropriately among the other <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> configuration lines â€” make sure to place it as you will see it placed in Colt's code editor in the next lecture. Check for it from the mentioned <strong>2:15</strong> timestamp in the next video, see the <strong>lines 6-10</strong> shown in Colt's <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> file at that point).</p><p>Again, the addition of this specific <code>devServer</code> configuration code wasn't explicitly shown in the next lecture video, so you need to manually add it by following the instructions above.</p><p>Therefore, by the end of the next video lecture "Webpack Dev Server", your complete <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> code should look like this:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">const path = require("path");
module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.ts",
  devtool: "inline-source-map",
  devServer: {
    static: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, "./"),
    },
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        use: "ts-loader",
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [".tsx", ".ts", ".js"],
  },
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    publicPath: "/dist",
  },
};</pre><p>If you have any questions or if you need any help with it, please don't hesitate to reach out on the course Q&amp;A boards.</p>
