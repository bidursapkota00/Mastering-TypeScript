<p>Hello everyone,</p><p>While following the next lecture video, if you get any errors creating a new React TypeScript project with the Create React App (create-react-app) tool, then you can use a tool named <strong>Vite</strong> as an alternative. Otherwise, if you don't get any errors with the Create React App (create-react-app), you can continue using it, and then you don't need to use the instructions below.</p><p>However, if you need to use <strong>Vite</strong> as an alternative to Create React App (create-react-app), follow the instructions below:</p><p>To use Vite, start your terminal, navigate to the location where you want to create your new project folder, and type this command:</p><p><code>npm create vite@latest</code></p><p>It will ask you to specify your project name, e.g., <code>shopping-app</code> (it will also use this name to create a new folder in the location where you executed the command above).</p><p>Then, you will see a list where you should press the arrow keys and select '<strong>React</strong>'.</p><p>Next, for the variant, select '<strong>TypeScript</strong>' from the menu.</p><p>Note:&nbsp;Alternatively, the steps mentioned above can also be done with this one single command:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">npm create vite@latest shopping-app -- --template react-ts</pre><p>Then, you can <code>cd</code> into the new project directory that was created, e.g., <code>cd shopping-app</code> </p><p>In the new project directory, you would run <code>npm install</code> to install the necessary node modules for it.</p><p>And then you would run the app with this specific command:</p><p><code>npm run dev</code></p><p>Again, if the Create React App&nbsp;(create-react-app) tool works for you, then you can still use that tool.</p><p>Please reach out to the course Q&amp;A boards if you have any questions or need any help.</p><p>Zarko â€” <em>Course Teaching Assistant</em> </p>
